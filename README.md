# Loan_Prediction_using_ML-master
 
 In this project we are going to use Classification for the person to wheather he should be given Loan or not based on the several features available in the datasets.

step 1 : Firstly we will try to select some of the important features from the dataset so that it can help us to predict the car prices more accurately.

step 2 : Then we will perform feature engineering on the selected feaures also removing outliers and then making the dummy variables for the category features.

step 3 :Then we have performed the Hyper Parameter tunning for the getting the best parameters we have available for this dataset.

step 4 : We will then going to apply the machine Learning Algorithm of Ensamble Learning as the Random Forest Classifier.

step 5 : Based on the trained models we can simply classifiy wheather new datapoint to wheather loan will be given or not.

step 6 : Then we will pickle the model for the later on usage.
